... -vnc :N # this runs 0.0.0.0:5900+N
... -vnc 127.0.0.1:N # this probably is opened up from the inside

If you want an encrypted session try to use vnc over ssh (vnc+ssh).

The canonical syntax would be for ssh port-forwarding would be:
  ssh -X -L localport:remotehost:remotehostport entrypoint

  for instance:
  invoke at remotehost via ssh:
    qemu-x86_64-system ... -vnc :1
  To get head:
    ssh -X -L 5901:192.168.254.254:5901 user@resolveme.com
