From the command line you need the "-usb" and "-usbdevice" options when starting up your virtual machine like so:

qemu-system-x86_64  -m 400 -hda windows.img -usb -usbdevice  host:1234:5678 (the -usb is compulsory)

Go to your monitor using Ctrl-Alt-2 and from within the monitor with your usb device connected run the following command to get the id of your usb device.

(qemu) info usbhost

You'll see a list of usb devices connected to your host. Now add your usb device to your guest with the following command.

(qemu) usb_add  host:1234:5678

Your usb device will now show up in your guest virtual machine.
