+ download iperf on windows guests and test speed that way, search iperf.exe
+ experiment with different virtual nics:
  + ne2k_pci
  => vm host/local network
    => winxp: 6Mbits/s
    => linux: 14Mbits/s
  + rtl8139
  => vm host
    => winxp: 70-80 Mbits/s
    => linux: 110-120 Mbits/s
  => local network:
    => winxp: 60-80 Mbits/s
    => linux: 100-120 Mbits/s
  + e1000
  => vm host 
    => linux: 150-200 Mbits/s
    => winxp: no drivers
  => local network
    => linux: 170-200 Mbits/s
    => winxp: no drivers
  @ virtio
  => There are too many to test. e1000 seems to be a good candidate for linux.
  => 'pcnet' also works out-of-the-box on windows xp, but vm guest 40-50 Mbits/s; local net 50-60 Mbits/s,
  => 'rtl8139 seems to be good (for now) for windows.
  => Actually e1000 is apparently better, according to some site, intel has the windows drivers for it.
+ Install windows drivers for e1000 http://www.linux-kvm.com/content/how-do-you-use-e1000-option-windows-guest

TODO 29-07-09
@ copy paste scripts to wiki
+ does tap0 also require same static ip as vm guest on tap0? -> No.
+ test virtio_eth on tap => crashes the system
@ write HOWTO on how to use qemu-ifup.sh script => Backed up to gmail e-mail
+ write qemu-ifdown.sh script
  => remove from bridge: brctl delif br0 tap0
  => put interface down: ip link set tap0 down
  => destroy tap0: tunctl -d tap0
  

TODO 20-07-09
+ install on guests: virtio_eth, also on windows
+ create shell script for launching virtio
  => kvm [...] -net nic,model=virtio -net user
+ use other keys from the wiki to activate the fucking windows xp image
+ make backup windows xp before doing any "tweakage"
@ crack windows xp, or make it register the fucking activation key
=> niet meer nodig, legitiem versie gebruikt
